## Description

During this workshop, we'll be using [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/wiki) to fetch some rockets and capsules and show them into components. This API will help us to explain the basic concepts of react:

- What is React
- JSX
- Render a Component
- Props
- State
- Lifecycle
- Events
- Conditional rendering
- Lists and keys

All this information can also be found in the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html).
